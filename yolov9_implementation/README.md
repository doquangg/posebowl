# YOLO V9 Implementation

This implementation of YOLO V9 is done strictly without the GPU, as per posebowl
guidelines. The directory ```yolov9``` is attached to this repo has a submodule.
Just a heads up. 

### Getting Started

Navigate to ```../yolov9/``` and run the following command: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
if that command doesn't work, I might've spelled requirements wrong; if that's
the case, you can autocomplete it with tab.

You'll also want to install ```roboflow```, using the following commmand:
```pip install roboflow```.
