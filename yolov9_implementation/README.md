# YOLO V9 Implementation

The directory ```yolov9``` is attached to this repo has a submodule.
Just a heads up. 

### Getting Started

Navigate to ```../yolov9/``` and run the following command: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
if that command doesn't work, I might've spelled requirements wrong; if that's
the case, you can autocomplete it with tab.
